# Hotel-Management-System01
This project is a Hotel Management System built using Java Swing. It includes three main parts:

Login Screen: Users enter their email and password to log in. If valid, it opens the hotel management system; otherwise, an error is displayed.

Hotel Booking System: Users select the number of rooms to book (up to 5) and choose specific rooms. Once confirmed, the booking is displayed.

Feedback System: After booking, users can provide feedback through a text area, which is submitted when the user clicks the "Submit Feedback" button.

The system uses Swing for GUI components and simple event handling to manage user actions.
